## Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

My entire data journey so far to remind myself how far I've come and what else I have to learn ðŸ˜„ 

coming up: uploading my own project for each concept listed 

### ðŸŒ± Currently dipped my feet into 

1. Python library- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seabron, plotly, altair, sklearn, streamlit, prophet, neural prophet, etc.
2. Visualization- graph types and interativeness customization with altair, converting altair visuals to html for deployment, streamlit to create quick web applications. 
3. Machine Learning- 
    Implemented ensemble Time series prediction model to predict ADV with 90% accuracy.
    Implemented Sentiment analyzer model to assess sentiment from formal and informal English and Malay.
    Implemented customer segmentation model for targeted marketing purpose. 
5. Web scraping- Implemented end to end web scraper in AWS, scraping data on an hourly bases with VPN. 
6. Building data pipelines: Using python, AWS Lambda, AWs Redshift, CRON scheduling, encrypting Personally identifiable information (PII) data columns
7. Web developemenmt: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AWS (compute, storage, network routing, Authorization)

 ### ðŸ’¬  Working on  
 1. Algorithms and datatypes: binary search, linear search, how array and linekd list work, big O notations, selection sort algorithm, stacked and queue data structure, quicksort (divide and conquer), hastable and how they work (collisions, load factor, hash function) 
 2. Maths- Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing, probability sampling, statistical significance, designing tests, inferential statistics 
 3. Others: Data mining, processing text data, understand APIs, filetypes (json, parquet, html, pickle, ...)
 4. Rust, MLOps, DevOps, Cloud computing, Handling big data hadoop, spark.
