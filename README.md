## Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

My entire data journey so far to remind myself how far I've come and what else I have to learn ðŸ˜„ 

coming up: uploading my own project for each concept listed 

### ðŸŒ± Currently dipped my feet into 

1. Python basics- native data types, logic and iterative loops, creating functions, etc. 
2. Python library- pandas, numpy (similar to MATLAB), matplotlib, seabron, plotly, altair (creating interesting interactive charts), sklearn, streamlit  
3. Visualization- graph types and interativeness customization with altair, converting altair visuals to html for deployment.  
4. Machine Learning- 
    Preprocesing for sklearn: cleaning (null values, outliers, format consistency,remove dupplicates, check datatype), normalizing/scaling, imputing null values, encoding categorical variable (one hot encoding), split train validation test set. 
    ML algorithms: supervised learning (logistic regression, linear regression, support vector machines (kernels), Decision tree classifier, K nearest neighbors, random forest) , unsupervised learning (k means clustering, PCA, t-SNE, SVD), optimization algorithm (iterative: gradient descent, numerical inverse method: normal equation), model evaluation (Accuracy, confusion f1 metrics, cross validation, ROC curve), neural network (forward and backward propagation, convolutional network) 
    More concepts: Bias vs variance (Regularization), Dimensionality reduction (Principal component analysis) 
5. Maths- Linear algebra, descriptive statistics (centrality, spread, skewness, frequency distribution) 
6. Others: ETL basics, API key generation, datetime, processing image data
7. Web developemenmt: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AWS (compute, storage, network routing, Authorization)

 ### ðŸ’¬  Working on  
 1. Python intermediate- set data type, object orientated programming, annonymous functions, arbitrary arguments in functions, creating checkpoints for code: (try, except, assert), decorators, the nuance in assigning vars to a mutable datatype (pointing to the same object in memory), REGEX, Recursion, CRON jobs. 
 2. Algorithms and datatypes: binary search, linear search, how array and linekd list work, big O notations, selection sort algorithm, stacked and queue data structure, quicksort (divide and conquer), hastable and how they work (collisions, load factor, hash function) 
 3. Python library - integrate with db environemnt (SQLalchemy, SQLite3), requests (APIs), os (managing hierarchical file data type)
 4. Visualization - explore animated plots and plots that automatically updates with live data library, apache airflow
 5. Machine Learning- 
    preprocessing for sklearn: under/oversampling for skewed data
    Algorithms: optimization (XBoost gradient descent)
    Model selection: 
 7. Maths- Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing, probability sampling, statistical significance, designing tests, inferential statistics 
 8. Others: Data mining, processing text data, understand APIs, filetypes (json, parquet, html, pickle, ...)
 9. Java Script, MLOps, DevOps, Cloud computing, Handling big data hadoop, spark.
