## Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹

My entire data journey so far to remind myself how far I've come and what else I have to learn ðŸ˜„ 

coming up: uploading my own project for each concept listed 

### ðŸŒ± Currently dipped my feet into 

1. Python basics- native data types, creating logic and iterative loops, creating functions, etc. 
2. Python library- pandas, numpy (similar concept to MATLAB), matplotlib, seabron, plotly, altair (creating interesting interactive charts), sklearn, streamlit  
3. Visualization- graph types and interativeness customization with altair, converting altair visuals to html for deployment.  
4. Machine Learning- 
    Preprocesing for sklearn: cleaning (null values, outliers, format consistency), normalizing/scaling, imputing null values, encoding categorical variable (one hot encoding), split train validation test set. 
    ML algorithms: supervised learning (logistic regression, linear regression, support vector machines (kernels), Decision tree classifier) , unsupervised learning (k means clustering), optimization algorithm (iterative: gradient descent, numerical, inverse method: normal equation), model evaluation (Accuracy, confusion f1 metrics, cross validation), neural network (forward and backward propagation) 
    More concepts: Bias vs variance (Regularization), Dimensionality reduction (Principal component analysis) 
5. Maths- Linear algebra, descriptive statistics (centrality, spread, skewness, frequency distribution) 
6. Others: ETL basics, API key generation, datetime ... 
7. Web developemenmt: Started learning HTML and CSS 

 ### ðŸ’¬  Working on  
 1. Python intermediate- set data type, object orientated programming, annonymous functions, arbitrary arguments in functions, creating checkpoints for code: (try, except, assert), decorators, the nuance in assigning vars to a mutable datatype (pointing to the same object in memory), REGEX, Recursion 
 2. Algorithms and datatypes: binary search, how array and linekd list work and their big O notations, selection sort algorithm, stack data structure, quicksort (divide and conquer), hastable and how they work (collisions, load factor, hash function) 
 3. Python library - integrate with db environemnt (SQLalchemy, SQLite3), requests, os
 4. Visualization - explore animated plots and plots that automatically updates with live data library, apache airflow to access and control local files, rw
 5. Machine Learning- 
    preprocessing for sklearn: under/oversampling for skewed data
    Algorithms: random forest, optimization (XBoost gradient descent), model evaluation (AUC, ROC curve)
 7. Maths- Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing, probability sampling, statistical significance, designing tests, inferential statistics 
 8. Others: Data mining, processing text data, processing image data, Data structures and algorithms, understand APIs, filetypes (json, parquet, html, pickle, ...)
 9. Java Script, MLOps, DevOps, Cloud computing, Handling big data hadoop, spark.
